For Win32 - CYGWIN change one line in Server.cc:95, NOCLDWAIT
For *BSD           change one line in Server.cc:95, NOCLDSTOP
        For Windows start Run->cmd
        cd to correct directory
        run IPC daemon for windows: ipc-daemon.exe &
        run server: wwwserver.exe
Compilation in BSD: make
Compilation in Win32+Cygwin: make -f Makefile.win32
On *BSD You need to run as ROOT, or specify ports higher than 1024
NOTE if You write as url: / then ./index.html from server WD will be used
BUT You can write: // as url, then FS: / will be used.
For Windows You will need also:
	cygwin1.dll (in CYGWIN package)
	ipc-daemon.exe (in CYGIPC package)
	this file are *NOT* in this package, because they are binary
	first You must start CygIPC: ipc-daemin.exe &

	EXAMPLES:
	start server in one terminal by typing:
		./wwwserver -c 8080 -a 8081
			or if You are root just:
		./wwwserver
	start another terminal, there try following:
		./terminal -p 8080 -c 'GET / HTTP/1.1'
		./terminal -p 80   -c 'GET/index.html HTTP/1.1'
			to get server answer at terminal
	start about 4 new terminals, there: 
	(each on different terminal assuming server on 8080 and 8081)
		mozilla http://localhost:8080/index.html
		konqueror 127.0.0.1:8080
		opera http://127.0.0.1:8080/some/path/to/file
	from a remote computer:
	get own IP: ifconfig (this on local)
	on remote: (assuming IP of computer running server is 194.29.178.165)
		links 194.29.178.165:8080
	Now you have about 4-5 browsers running on your server, now You can
		try all browsers to get some different files
		see all images, check all links in main page
		try to get too big file, try to get device:
			got URL: http://localhost:8080/dev, (...):8080:/dev/tty
	Now check administrative ports (using ./terminal or telnet, I assume terminal)
		./terminal -p 8081 -c 'suspend'
			all browsers should be frozen (but some newer can *RECONNECT*)
		./terminal -p 8081 -c 'resume'
			should unblock those who were frozen
		./terminal -p 8081 -c 'reset'
			should disconnect all clients, but most browsers
			will reconnect at any click or activity
	Telnet:
		telnet 127.0.0.1 8081
			in telnet already connected
				halt
			should disconnect automatically
			but on 8080 port will not disconnect
			to disconnect do:
				CTRL+]
				telnet> quit
	Browse FS a little, browse FS from remote
	try saving some big files on a remote client
	Then
		use CTRL+C on server process to stop SERVER
		*OR*
		./terminal -p 8081 -c 'halt' to stop SERVER
		*OR*
		./terminal -i 194.29.178.165 -p 8081 -c 'halt' to stop SERVER from REMOTE
	Do *NOT* use kill -9 on server, it will not save LOG file
		(possibly save partialy, unsynced)
	Now when server is stopped
		vi Server.LOG (or other file You selected as LOG)
			you can see all clients how much send and
			total bytes transferred by the server
	To see which options server accepts just read startup messages
	Server displays its options
Thats All
