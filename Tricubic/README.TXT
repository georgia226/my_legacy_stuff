suggested key press: ' ' '-' '-' '5' '5' '7' '7' 'i' 'i' 'z' 'z' etc
help is written to cmd line
to compile U will need cygwin: cprogram.bat

sign.exe is very funny: it uses SPLINE interpolation to write things using mouse
to use rotations try w/s/a/d/e/x
spline degree is initially 2, to use other try from cmd line ./sign 3 for 3 degree or 
./sign n n e [1...]
